<h1>My Youtube™</h1>
My Youtube™ is an extension aimed at avid Youtubers. It acts as a notifier by letting you know when your favorite 
Youtubers have uploaded new videos.

At the moment, My Youtube™ is only available for Google Chrome and can be installed from the Chrome Web Store using the
following URL: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-youtube/cphiahocnjphccbcpaabkhbppnilapeg
 
<h2>Important source files</h2>
background.js - Main js script that checks for new videos in the background<br />
popup.js - The js that runs when the broswer icon is clicked, it loads and displays all videos<br />
popup.html - HTML entrypoint for the extension popup (opens when the broswer icon is clicked)<br />
<br />

*Any feedback is appreciated. If you have any suggestions to improve this extension, don't hesitate to let me know.*

<h3>What's happening now?</h3>
I have plans to start developing the Firefox version soon. I also want to add an easy way to "download" your settings so that if you install the extension in another computer, you can easily "upload" your settings into the new machine. This means that you won't have to add all that channels that you had manually. That can be quite tedious.
